## Ride State Transitions ##

The following diagram and legend describe the various ride state transitions that can occur throughout a ride's lifetime.

>**Notes:** 
>* The orange nodes in the diagram indicate terminal states, which cannot transition to any other state.
>* In the case of a pre-booked (future) ride, the ride remains in the ACCEPTED state for a longer period of time, and only transitions to DRIVER_ASSIGNED shortly before the pickup time.
