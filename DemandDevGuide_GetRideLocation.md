# HERE Demand API Workflow: *Getting a Ride's Location* #

You may want to poll periodically for the ride location, for example so that you can display it dynamically on a map.

>**Note:** You retrieve the ride location from the **RideLocation** object, not the **Ride** object. See [Ride Object vs. RideLocation Object
](DemandDevGuide_BasicRideConcepts.md#RideAndRideLocation) to learn more about these two objects.

**To get the current ride location:**

Call *GetRideLocation*. This returns a **RideLocation** object that contains the rideâ€™s geo-location, and optionally the estimated time of arrival at the pickup or dropoff location.

>**Note:** This call is identical for the C2S and S2S APIs.
