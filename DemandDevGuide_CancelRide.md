# HERE Demand API Workflow: *Cancelling a Ride* #

You may want to cancel a ride after it was booked, following a cancellation request from the user.

>**Note:** Whether ride cancellation is allowed depends on the supplier's policy. If cancellation isn't allowed, the user will be fined, and the call to *CancelRide* will fail. *CancelRide* will also fail if you try to cancel a ride that isn't active.

**To cancel a ride after it was booked:**

Call *CancelRide*, using the **ride_id** value that you received as a response to *CreateRide*.

>**Note:** This call is identical for the C2S and S2S APIs.
